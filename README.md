Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

```bash
npx ember-intl-analyzer
```


Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ember-intl-analyzer can be configured by creating a `config/ember-intl-analyzer.js`
file in your app:

```js
export default {
  whitelist: [
    /^countries\./,
    /^currency\./,
    /^validations\.errors\./,
    /^[^.]+\.warnings\.[^.]+$/,
  ],
};
```

### `whitelist`

If you use dynamic translations keys like this:
```js
this.intl.t(`countries.${code}`)
```
then ember-intl-analyzer can not easily understand what translation keys are
being used here. In that case it will ignore the dynamic translation key and
show the corresponding translations as unused.

To prevent that from happening you can configure a `whitelist`, which accepts an
array of regular expressions that will be checked when looking for unused
translations.

### `errorOnUnusedWhitelistEntries`

When using a whitelist to ignore dynamic translation keys, it can be easy to forget
to clean up the whitelist when an entry is not used anymore. You can opt-in to make
this analyzer error when this occurs, by setting the `errorOnUnusedWhitelistEntries`
flag in the configuration file:

```js
export default {
  errorOnUnusedWhitelistEntries: true,
};
```

### `analyzeConcatExpression`

If your template contains translations like this:
```hbs
{{t (concat "actions." (if @isEditing "save" "publish"))}}
```
then ember-intl-analyzer does not detect that `actions.save` and `actions.publish`
are in fact used translations, so they can be incorrectly flagged as missing or
unused. As the `concat` helper can make it harder to read, it's encouraged to
rewrite it to for example:
```hbs
{{if @isEditing (t "actions.save") (t "actions.publish")}}
```

However, if your application relies heavily on this `concat` helper, then rewriting
may not be the best option for you. In that case, you can opt-in to analyze `concat`
expressions too by setting the `analyzeConcatExpression` flag in the configuration file:

```js
export default {
  analyzeConcatExpression: true,
};
```

### `externalPaths`

If your application uses translations provided by (external) addons, then those
translations will show up as missing by default. In order to include such translations,
you can define `externalPaths` in the configuration file as follows:

```js
export default {
  externalPaths: ['my-addon'],
};
```

This example will try to find translation files in `node_modules/my-addon/translations`.
Patterns supported by [`globby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby) are also
possible here, e.g. this:
```js
externalPaths: ['@*/*']
```
will look up translations in scoped addons like `node_modules/@company/scoped-addon/translations`.

### `translationFiles`

By default, this addon will try to find missing and unused translations in any YAML or
JSON file within the `translations` folders of your application (`['**/*.json', '**/*.yaml', '**/*.yml']`).
However, if you would like to only analyze a subset of translation files, you can override
`translationFiles` in the configuration file as follows:

```js
export default {
  translationFiles: ['**/en.yaml'],
};
```

This example will try to find all `en.yaml` files in the different `translations`
folders, but any patterns supported by [`globby`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/globby) are also
possible here.

### `babelParserPlugins` `extensions`

If your application uses doesn't parse correctly because it requires a specific babel plugin you can specifiy them in the config file under the key `babelParserPlugins` a list on plugins can be found [here](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-parser#plugins).

For example if you would like typescript support you can specify the `typescript` plugin, although please note if the plugin introduces a new file extension you will also need to specifiy that in the `extensions` property. See the examples below.

Typescript example
```js
export default {
  babelParserPlugins: ['typescript'],
  extensions: ['.ts'],
};
```

Jsx example
```js
export default {
  babelParserPlugins: ['jsx'],
  extensions: ['.jsx'],
};

Gts example
```js
export default {
  babelParserPlugins: ['typescript'],
  extensions: ['.gts'],
};
```

### `--fix`
If your application has a lot of unused translations you can run the command with
the `--fix` to remove them. Remember to double check your translations as dynamic
translations need to be whitelisted or they will be removed!

### `Custom t helpers`

By default this package will only check templates for `ember-intl`'s `t` helper, but
in some cases you may want to create a custom wrapping helper e.g. `{{t-error 'error.key' error}}`
this helper could manage generic error situation but also accept a custom error key.
If your app uses custom `t` helpers you can register them in you config under the helpers key.

**Note: This requires the translation key to be the first parameter of the helper**

```js
export default {
  helpers: ['t-error'],
};
```

Discover stand-alone translation keys 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, only translation keys which are immediately translated are picked up by the analyzer. If you have translation keys which are not immediately translated, but are used in your application, you can mark them using the `translationKey` tagged template util.

```diff
+ import { translationKey } from 'ember-intl-analyzer/translation-key';

- const thisIsAKey = 'this.is.a.key';
+ const thisIsAKey = translationKey`this.is.a.key`;
```

This will mark the key `this.is.a.key` as used in your application, and it will not be flagged as unused by the analyzer. This can be a useful tool to mark keys which are used in your application, so they don't have to be added to the whitelist.

Caveats
